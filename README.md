# Battleship

This was a command line REPL version of the board game Battleship.  

This project was one of the more fun ones in the 1st quarter curriculum at Turing. It solidified my understanding of evaluating user input, the use of classes in Ruby, advanced manipulation of fundamental data structures (hashes, arrays, strings, etc.), complex if/else conditionals, and a tiny bit of UX/UI (in the realm of the command line).
